* Usage:
import them library, them do
```
hiplot.plot1(DIRNAME, NAME, YTITLENAME, DATA)
```
where
 - DIRNAME is a string to specify where the output figure is stored
 - NAME is the name string for the generated figure
 - YTITLENAME is the name string for the y-title in the generated figure
 - DATA is a python dict object. The x-tick of the figure is extracted
   from the dict-keys

* Note
Take a look at the do_plot1 function in plot.py. There are other stuff
that can be reconfigured. But each of them has a default so it is OK
to leave them along (until necessary).
